    <h1><b>How Are New Yorkers Effected By The Earned Income Tax Credit?</b></h1>
     By <a href="http://jeremysilksmith.com">Jeremy Silk Smith </a>
    <p>A few weeks ago, President Obama released his annual budget. Republicans lambasted it and called it “dead on arrival.” But there is one part of his budget that has the potential to actually become law: increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>

    <p> This is because one of the champions of this tax credit is Speaker of The House, Paul Ryan. According to Dylan Mathews of Vox.com, the proposed increase by President Obama is almost identical to Speaker Ryan’s plan. The only difference is how they pay for it. In the partisan gridlock of Washington, how can the Republican Speaker agree with a Democratic President on expanding a social safety net program? It works. A study conducted by the Brookings Institute states that in 2012 alone, it lifted 6.5 million people out of poverty while promoting work.</p>
    
    <p>So how and why is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) so successful at lifting people out of poverty? To get a sense of its success, lets take a small look at how it impacts New York City.</p>
    
    <p>The EITC gives cash back to families based on how much income a household earns and how many children they have. As your income rises and if you have more kids, your tax credit gets larger but is capped at $40,000. So lets take a look at the data from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance 2010 report on the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>

<h2>Average Tax Credit Value</h2>

<br>
    <p>It should not be surprising that Manhattan has a much smaller average return because it is the wealthiest borough. The Bronx and Brooklyn have some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city and it is not surprising they have higher rates.</p>

    <p>So people who make less money get more of a credit then people with more money. But do the poorest people get the most? Let’s look at the breakdown, in each borough of how many total families are eligible for the EITC based on their tax bracket.</p>

    <p>So families who make between  $8,000 and $16,000 are the ones who qualify the most. This is part of the incentive that Republicans like. That if you are able to work more, i.e. increase your income, you can get a larger tax credit. Anything dealing with the tax code is extremely complex and this is only meant, as a snapshot at understanding the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>
